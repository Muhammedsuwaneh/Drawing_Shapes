Drawing Mathematical Shapes

The Program draws:
1. A Line - By requiring points a and b from user
   - y = ax + b
2. A Parabola - By requiring points a, b and c 
   - y = ax^2 + bx + c
3. A Circle - By requiring a radius(r) and center (a, b) 
   - (x-a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2

The program draws a cordinate system and fixes the shape in it

The x and y cordinates range from [-10, 10] however can increase to make
the shape look clearer and fit on the console.

The program uses simple nested for loops to solve and plot the graph
